Why does this mod exist? Aren't there like a million ore mods already? Yeah, there are. But, like most mods that exist, they usually add game-breaking elements that completely ruin the vanilla Minecraft experience. This mod is less a "mod" and more an "expansion," expanding on the vanilla experience without going crazy.

Over the years, mining in Minecraft has gotten less and less valuable. The core idea of this mod is to add a small selection of ores that add more value to mining. Each ore/resource is designed to be as vanilla-balanced as possible. 

This mod adds:

7 new ores (Copper, Tin, Mithril, Platinum, Black Diamond, Salt, and Sulfur)
3 new types of Amor, Tools, and Weapons (Bronze, Mithril, and Black Diamond)
1 new type of food, Jerky
5 new building blocks not mentioned above
blocks

New ores and their uses:
   Copper: Used with Tin to create Bronze.
   Tin: Used with Copper to create Bronze.
   Bronze: A combination of Copper and Tin. Used to create equipment that is worse than Iron, but better than Stone. Can substitute Iron ingots in most crafting recipes.
   Mithril: Used to create equipment that is worse than Diamond, but better than Iron. Can substitute Iron ingots in most crafting recipes.
   Platinum: Exceedingly rare. Used to create a Platinum Crown. More (non-armor) uses coming soon!
   Black Diamond: Exceedingly rare. Used to create equipment that is better than Diamond (but not too much). Requires Diamonds instead of Sticks in tool recipes.
   Salt: A new type of earthly resource that is used to create food instead of equipment. Only found near the surface. Currently you can only use it to make Jerky, but I plan to add more uses as I come up with them. Jerky is awesome, by the way :3
   Sulfur: Only found in the nether. Used with charcoal to create gunpowder.
 

The only new recipes added (not including armor/block recipes) are:
   Copper and Tin (one copper ore, one tin ore, shapeless):
   Jerky (a raw meat with 4 piles of salt, shaped)
   Gunpowder (3 sulfur, 1 charcoal, shapeless)

Tool and armor recipes are the same as vanilla Minecraft. You can substitute Bronze and Mithril for most recipes that require Iron.
